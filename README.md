# Virtual Assistant

This project is a **Virtual Assistant** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The assistant can perform various tasks like opening websites, telling the time, and answering basic queries. It uses the `SpeechSynthesis` and `SpeechRecognition` APIs to interact with the user through voice commands.

## Features

- Voice-activated commands using the browser's `SpeechRecognition` API.
- Ability to perform small tasks like:
  - Opening websites (e.g., Google search).
  - Providing the current date and time.
  - Responding to greetings.
  - Opening applications (based on command input).
- Visual interaction with animations and a dynamic avatar.
